> **Preserve your family's story for generations to come.**

## A Unique Opportunity for Our Generation

**We stand at a historic crossroads.** For the first time in human history, we have the tools to give future generations an intimate, authentic window into their ancestors' lives—not through faded letters or distant portraits, but through their own voices, faces, and stories.

Our generation has a profound responsibility: **to honor the time our family members have spent on this earth.** Their triumphs, struggles, and defeats shaped who we are today. Their wisdom, earned through decades of living, deserves to be preserved with the same care we'd give to any precious heirloom.

**Never before has such an opportunity existed.** Previous generations could only dream of hearing their great-great-grandparents speak, seeing them laugh, understanding what kept them up at night. We can give that gift to the future—but only if we act now.

This is GitFam: a digital family archive that ensures your family's legacy lives on, accessible and intact, for centuries to come.

## What is GitFam?

GitFam is an open-source, git-based family history project that combines:
- 🎥 **Video interviews** with family members (inspired by oral history projects)
- 📝 **Written profiles** documenting lives, experiences, and wisdom
- 🌳 **Family tree structure** showing relationships across generations
- 💾 **Built-in redundancy** through git version control
- 🔓 **Complete ownership** of your family's data

## Why GitFam?

### For Families
- **Own your data** - No subscriptions, no corporate servers, no lock-in
- **Future-proof** - Built on simple, open standards (Markdown, MP4, Git)
- **Redundant by design** - Clone to multiple locations, never lose a memory
- **Collaborative** - Family members can contribute from anywhere
- **Private or public** - You decide who has access

### For Future Generations
- **Authentic voices** - Video interviews preserve personality, not just facts
- **Context and wisdom** - Understand not just what happened, but why it mattered
- **Family identity** - Know where you come from and what values you inherit
- **Living history** - Stories that textbooks and databases can never capture

## Project Philosophy

GitFam is designed to be:
1. **Simple** - No databases, no complex software. Just files and folders.
2. **Accessible** - Technical and non-technical family members can contribute
3. **Replicable** - Any family can fork this and make it their own
4. **Long-lasting** - Built to survive decades, not dependent on any company

## A Final Word

**Time is running out.** Our elders won't be here forever. Their stories, once lost, can never be recovered. 

Don't let future generations wonder who their ancestors were. Give them the gift of knowing—truly knowing—where they came from.

Start today. Your family's legacy depends on it.
