# GitFam Interview Guide

This guide provides suggested questions for interviewing family members. The goal is to capture authentic stories, wisdom, and personality—not to create a polished documentary.

## Interview Setup Philosophy

**Inspired by:** Soft White Underbelly, StoryCorps
- **Keep it simple:** Two iPhones on tripods, one for each person
- **Minimal editing:** Raw and real is better than perfect
- **Let them talk:** Follow interesting tangents, don't rush
- **Be present:** This is a conversation, not an interrogation
- **Record everything:** You can organize later, but you can't re-capture the moment

## Technical Setup

### Equipment
- 2 smartphones (iPhone or equivalent)
- 2 tripods or stable surfaces
- Good lighting (natural light from window is fine)
- Quiet location
- Backup power/chargers

### Camera Setup
- One camera on interviewer, one on subject
- Landscape orientation
- Frame: chest up (not just talking heads)
- Test audio levels before starting
- Have backup recording device just in case

### Before Recording
- Make subject comfortable
- Explain you're preserving family history
- Assure them there's no "wrong" answer
- Let them know you can pause anytime
- Have water available
